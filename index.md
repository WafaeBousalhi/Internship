👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hello! I'm Wafae, a data analyst and neuroscience researcher with a passion for turning data into stories, insights, and action. Below, you'll find a showcase of the projects I've worked on, especially during my Flip Robo internship and academic career. Each project reflects my hands-on experience in Python, machine learning, data wrangling, and automation.
